A simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in Java using JDBC and MySQL.

## Features

1. **Create:** Insert new data into the table.
2. **Read Specific Row:** Retrieve data for a specific ID from the table.
   - If the entered ID is not available, the program displays a message that the data is not available.
3. **Read All Data:** Retrieve and display the entire table data.
4. **Update Specific Row:** Modify the data/name of a specific row in the table.
5. **Delete Specific Data:** Remove a specific row from the table.
   - If the entered ID for deletion is not available, the program displays a message that the data is not available.
6. **Exit:** Quit the application.

## Description

The project consists of five different Java classes:

1. **App:** Contains a switch statement with cases for each CRUD operation.
2. **Customer:** Represents a customer entity with getter functions for all columns and a method to return customer data as a string.
3. **CustomerDao:** Stores functions for CRUD operations, including create, read, update, and delete.
4. **DB:** Includes methods to check database availability and establish a connection.
5. **Query:** Separates queries for each CRUD operation.
